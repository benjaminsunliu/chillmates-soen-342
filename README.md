### Design Patterns Used:
- **Singleton**: Used for Catalogs to ensure only one instance of each catalog exists.
- **Data Mapper**: Used to map data between the database and the application.

### Architecture:
- **Console Application**: The application is a console-based application that interacts with the user through the command line.
- **Domain Layer**: Contains the core business logic and classes from the domain model.
- **Persistence Layer**: Contains the classes responsible for data access and storage, using the Data Mapper pattern.
